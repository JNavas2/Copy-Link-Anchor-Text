**THIS ONE REALLY WORKS!**

On desktop, use the context menu or toolbar icon/shortcut to toggle copy mode.   
On Android, activate the extension through the Extensions menu, then tap a link to copy its anchor text.

## **Features**

- Copy anchor text of any link with a simple tap or right-click.
- Context menu option on desktop platforms.
- Toolbar icon and keyboard shortcut toggle for copy mode on desktop.
- Supports persistent copy mode (stay ON until manually turned OFF).
- Designed to work on both desktop Firefox and Firefox for Android.
- Lightweight and privacy-focused with no ads or tracking.
- Open source and free to use.

## **Installation & Onboarding**

- On install or update, the extension opens the **Options** page for onboarding and settings.
- The Options page includes instructions, persistent mode toggle, privacy policy, and uninstall option.
- Responsive design ensures usability on desktop and mobile devices.

## **How to Use**

### **Desktop**

- **Right-click** on any link and select **"Copy Link Anchor Text"** to copy immediately.
- Use the **toolbar icon** to toggle tap-to-copy mode; when active, clicking a link copies instead of navigating.
- Optionally use the **keyboard shortcut** `Ctrl+Shift+C` to toggle copy mode quickly.

### **Android**

- Activate the extension from the **Firefox Extensions menu**.
- With copy mode enabled, simply **tap a link**; its anchor text is copied instead of opening the link.
- Persistent mode can be enabled in Options to keep copy mode ON until you turn it off.
